# Temperature Converter

A program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This project helps practice using breakpoints to debug conversion logic.

## Features
- Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Uses breakpoints to inspect input and output values.
- Handles edge cases like extremely high or low temperatures.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Set breakpoints in the code (e.g., before and after each conversion).
4. Run the program in debug mode (`F5`).
5. Use the **Watch** window to monitor temperature values.

## Debugging Tips
- Set breakpoints to inspect input and output values.
- Use conditional breakpoints to debug specific scenarios (e.g., converting absolute zero).
